# Code Challenge
  
This is a snippet of code from one of the most mentally taxing takehomes I've ever received. In the process I had to learn about a data mining technique called **Min Hashing** and implement it in code. I managed to learn about the technique, learn about hash functions, find the appropriate hash function, and write the code in roughly 4 hours.

The code snippet has 3 functions:
- **estimateDistinctElements** Estimates the number of distinct items in a set using Min Hashing
- **estimateDistinctElementsParallel** Estimates the number of distinct items in a set using Min Hashing in parallel
- **calculateEmpiricalAccuracy** Evaluates the accuracy of the estimates generated from the two above functions.
